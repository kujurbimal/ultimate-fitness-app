# Ultimate Fitness App - Scaffold

This repository is a starter scaffold for the cross-platform fitness application described in the product spec.

## Contents
- backend/  -> FastAPI backend with example endpoints
- frontend_web/ -> Simple static landing page + React/Next placeholder
- mobile/ -> React Native starter README and notes
- infra/ -> Dockerfile and docker-compose sample
- sql/ -> example database schema (Postgres)

## How to use
1. Inspect `backend/` to run the API locally (FastAPI + Uvicorn).
2. Open `frontend_web/` to preview the landing page or hook into Next.js.
3. Follow mobile/README.md to start a React Native project for iOS/Android.

This scaffold is intentionally minimal to help you iterate quickly.
